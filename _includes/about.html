        After realizing my passion for the end-user impact of tech while studying CS in college, I started my Product Management 
        journey back in 2016 as an intern at Microsoft. I've since worked in various areas of the company, working on Big Data platforms 
        for Azure, Python tools, and Jupyter Notebooks. I migrated over to GitHub in 2021 to work on educational tools for teaching CS with GitHub. Over the past five years, I've 
        had the opportunity to present at numerous conferences, lead a product from its inception to first 100,000 users, and constantly 
        learn from those around me.

        Outside of work, I live in Seattle and love to do all the classic Pacific Northwest things. Getting outside with skiing, hiking, and intramural soccer. Stretching my creativity with photography 
        and improv. And of course, getting Seattle-cultured by exploring breweries. I spend a lot of time with my Nintendo Switch, and stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/baikat">Twitch</a>. I also foster dogs and cats, and am hoping to adopt one of my own this year!
        And finally, as a Cleveland native and UMich alum, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my love of the Cleveland Browns and Michigan football (Go Blue!).
