        After falling in love with the impact of tech on its end users while studying CS in college, I started my Product Management 
        journey back in 2016 as an intern at Microsoft. I've since worked in various areas of the company, working on Big Data platforms 
        for Azure, Python tools, Jupyter Notebooks, and now educational tools for teaching CS at GitHub. Over the past five years, I've 
        had the opportunity to present at multiple conferences, lead a product from its inception to first 1000,000 users, and constantly 
        learn and challenge myself.

        Outside of work, I live in Seattle and love to do all the classic Pacific Northwest things. Getting outside with skiing, hiking, and soccer. Being creative with photography 
        and improv. And of course, getting Seattle-cultured by exploring breweries. I spend a lot of time with my Nintendo Switch, and stream on <a href="twitch.tv/baikat">Twitch</a>. I also foster dogs and cats, and am hoping to adopt one of my own this year!
        And finally, as a Cleveland native and UMich alum, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my love of the Cleveland Browns and Michigan football (Go Blue!).
